 The Virtual Reality-based E-commerce Web Application is an advanced website inspired
by the meta verse concept. The unique thing about this web application is that it provides
virtual reality mode to the customer so that the customers can experience the real-time feeling of the e-commerce store if they have VR headsets. Without a VR headset, they
can visit the website and can also do a 3d virtual tour of the store. On the basis of
user body measurement inputs, we are also providing the best suggestion for the size
that will fit the customer's body. Other than these major functionalities this application is
delivering advanced features to the customers like advanced searching, User-friendly navigation,
Advanced Searching, Product Filtering, Latest news section in which the latest
discount and sales will be displayed to the customer, Conversion of currencies to different
countryâ€™s currencies etc.\

\end{center}
Online shopping has become a major trend nowadays. Customers prefer it rather than going shopping physically as it is less costly and less time-consuming. That is why many shopping stores are going digital and enabling E-commerce features in their setup. However, customers face issues and satisfaction is less while shopping online as they cannot see how the product might look in reality. All they see is a 2d image, description, and reviews of previous customers. Showing 3d models of the products in the virtually created store which can be accessed through VR headsets can make the customers feel as if they are shopping physically. Metaverse concepts are used for this application. So Virtual reality-based E-Commerce store is created that would provide a positive and realistic experience to the customers in the metaverse. The core technology is virtual reality.
First, we create a basic E-commerce website named MetaMart with all related features and functionalities. Then 3d tour and VR mode that is created in Unity 3D is integrated with the website. For VR mode, an oculus headset is required. Initially in the application, garments, and outerwear will be the main products. 3D garments will be placed upon avatars with customized measurements so that customers can map them to themselves and choose the best suitable one. In this way, customers can explore MetaMart with virtual reality functionalities so that they can experience this innovative way of buying products satisfactorily by roaming around the store and viewing products that are mostly garments in 3D view and exploring the latest Metaverse technology in the application.
